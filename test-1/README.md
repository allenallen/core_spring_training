# Integration Testing and Profiles (`test-1`)

In this lab you will refactor the `RewardsApplicationServiceTests` using Spring's system test support library to simplify and improve the performance of your system. You will then use Spring profiles to define multiple tests using different implementations of the `AccountRepository`, `MerchantRepository` and `RewardRepository` for different environments.

What you will learn:

1. The recommended way of system testing an application configured by Spring
2. How to write group configurations for different environments
