# JPA Simplification with Spring (`jpa-1`)

In this lab you will implement the repositories of the rewards application with the Java Persistence API (JPA). You'll configure JPA to map database rows to objects, use JPA APIs to query objects, and write tests to verify mapping behavior.

What you will learn:

1. How to configure domain objects with annotations to map these to relational structures
2. How to use the JPA APIs to query objects
3. How to configure JPA in a Spring environment
4. How to test JPA-based repositories
